# SQL for Data Science with BigQuery

By late 2022 I had been using SQL on BigQuery for more than five years. I had become quite comfortable with SQL, but often resorted to Google when I couldn't remember the exact syntax of certain functions. Frequently I'd land on Stack Overflow pages I'd previously visited many times.

At the same time my team at work _finally_ landed a SQL orchestration toolâ€“putting a stake in the ground that our data warehouse would be built with SQL using BigQuery. I determined that by the end of 2023 I wanted to become a SQL expert, and the best way I know to level-up _any_ skill is by learning, writing, and teaching.
